####Clicktime
A clicking game.

#####Functions
The functions included here are grouped specifically so that they can be taken and individually used elsewhere. The ``colorGen()`` method and the 
``setMargin()`` functions can be used and applied to generate any random colors/margins and used for any HTML. Just edit the parameters for the 
margins, and it will generate any number between the two settings.

The ``removeGame()`` function is imperative to the operation of this game. It provides the timing information for displaying panes, calculating 
graph information, and generating the charts themselves. It's written in a combinations of JS and jQ, and it uses both DOM elements and jQ targeting.

#####Charts
For the charts, I used the ``Chart.js`` library, which can be found [here](http://www.chartjs.org/).
